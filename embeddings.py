This includes demand deposit accounts, which allow the accountholder to withdraw money from the account without advance notice, as well as accounts on which the accountholder earns interest such as savings accounts, certificates of deposit, health savings accounts and individual retirement accounts. \
    Our solutions enable users to set up and maintain deposit accounts in a manner that complies with applicable regulations. They make it possible to track transactions (debits and credits), calculate balances, pay interest, assess overdraft or other fees, generate necessary notices and statements, produce tax reporting documents, and record and modify information about parties related to an account such as names, addresses, tax IDs, contact information and the nature of the partyâ€™s relationship to the account. \
    Our account processing solutions accommodate deposit accounts for individuals, small business and large enterprises. To accommodate the special needs of business accounts, they offer functionality such as nightly sweeps and repurchase agreements."
